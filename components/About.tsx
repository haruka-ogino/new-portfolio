        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer dedicated to personal and professional
          growth. Having transitioned from civil engineering, I have discovered
          a deep passion for coding. The ability to solve problems and bring
          ideas to life with just a few keystrokes fuels my creativity and
          ambition. I am currently seeking a software development role where I
          can contribute to dynamic teams, further develop my expertise in
          full-stack development, and continue to inspire and encourage women to
          pursue careers in STEM, especially in software engineering.{' '}
